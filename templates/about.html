  <center>"Spread your knowledge. Spread it using Spreddit®!" --Socrates, probably. </center>
  <br><br>
  Spreddit® (in no way a knockoff of Reddit®) is a forum for spreading news.<br><br>
  You can create an account and make posts, or comment on others' posts.<br><br>
  You can delete your own posts along with all the comments on them.<br><br>
  Posts and comments are timestamped; posts appear in order of newest first, while comments are listed in chronological order. <br><br>
  There is a search box on the homepage that lets you retrieve all posts and comments that contain a certain phrase. <br><br>
  Go forth, and Spreddit!
